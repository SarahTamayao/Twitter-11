Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to improve the smoothness of the app (scrolling, transitions, etc.)
2. How to test the app without continously calling the API (causing lockouts)
